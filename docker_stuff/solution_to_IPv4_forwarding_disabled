problem: while creating a container on centos 7 we get the following error:

WARNING: IPv4 forwarding is disabled. Networking will not work.

as a result docker container cannon ping or use yum/apt-get or any other network usage 


solution:

1. add the following: net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
   in: /etc/sysctl.conf

2. service network restart

3. type: sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
