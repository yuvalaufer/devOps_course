in case hostname of puppet master is not "puppet" need to add the following configuration to puppet.conf of the puppet master:

[main]
server = <puppet server hostname with fqdn >

e.g:

[main]
server = puppetmaster.yuval.private



also, configure the following in the puppet.conf of the puppet client:

[agent]
server = <puppet server hostname with fqdn >

e.g:

[agent]
server = puppetmaster.yuval.private
