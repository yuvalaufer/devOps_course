1.
use itai's jenkins for it.
address:

jenkins.lel.bz

configure a github organization build on jenkins , which scans you git repository and creates a new build every git push

important notes: 
*   repository must contan a valid jenkins pipeline configuration file called "Jenkinsfile" in order to understand what to do

*   in order for it to work need to define a webhook in the git repository settings

in order for webhook to work I've configured my router to forward incoming traffic in port 8080 to port 8080 on local ip addrss on virtual server.


2.
configure a jenkins slave on your aws server
